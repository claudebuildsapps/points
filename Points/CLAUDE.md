# Points App Guidelines

## Build Commands
- Build: `xcodebuild -scheme Points -configuration Debug`
- Run: Open `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode and use Run button (âŒ˜R)
- Clean: `xcodebuild clean -scheme Points`

## Guidance for refactoring or development
- Focus on implementing requested changes accurately and efficiently
- Only commit changes when explicitly asked with a "commit" command
- When committing, write a descriptive commit message following Git best practices
- Don't ask about committing changes unless specifically requested
- Use the iOS simulator or Xcode for testing rather than scripts

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use 4-space indentation consistently
- Follow Swift naming conventions: `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for types
- Organize code with `// MARK:` comments
- Use Swift's type inference where appropriate
- Implement robust error handling with `do`-`try`-`catch` blocks
- Use guard statements for early returns and unwrapping optionals
- Employ extensions to add functionality to existing types
- Prefer value types (structs) over reference types (classes) when appropriate
- Use CoreData best practices for persistent storage operations
- Maintain separation between UI and business logic
- Document complex functions with comment blocks
- Use method chaining via `apply` for fluent interfaces

## Application purpose
- To track routines and tasks attributed by points, iterations, targets, maximums, bonuses, and more.
- More to come

## Tasks
- Nothing here yet

## Notes
- The app now uses SwiftUI as the primary UI framework
- UIKit controllers (ViewController and TaskViewController) have been removed as they were duplicating functionality
- The tabs have been moved into the footer with the buttons sitting above them
- A unified architecture with the TaskControllers singleton is used to manage task actions
- The tab height has been reduced by ~30% to 42pt (from original 60pt)

## Critical instructions
- Do not make any attempts to create files that already exist in the codebase
- If you have questions where you are not sure about the implementation, ask before making any changes
- If you notice a way that we can reduce the amount of token exchange (e.g. by refactoring in an intelligent way), please point them out
- Do not examine files larger than 500kb to save compute resources (especially asset files)
- Primarily work within the /Points directory as the main source folder
- Skip parsing the Assets.xcassets contents unless specifically needed for a UI change
- Only commit changes when explicitly asked with the word "commit"
- Keep responses concise and focused on the requested task
